With the arrival of our first full connectome, we have massively expanded the number of neuron types represented on VFB. Many of these are currently poorly characterised, but where these are associated with new publications, we've added detailed descriptions. 

 - This includes substantial improvements to our collection of [antennal lobe projection neurons](https://v2.virtualflybrain.org/org.geppetto.frontend/geppetto?q=FBbt_00067123,SubclassesOf) ([Bates et al., 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.042); [Marin et al., 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.028)).

 - This also includes much more fine grained cell-typing for neurons in the adult mushroom body ([Li et al., 2020](http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62576)). For example, we now have terms for the four unique [gamma-s Kenyon cells](https://v2.virtualflybrain.org/org.geppetto.frontend/geppetto?q=FBbt_00049830,SubclassesOf) (pictured below) as well as an increased range of [mushroom body output neurons (MBONS)](https://v2.virtualflybrain.org/org.geppetto.frontend/geppetto?q=FBbt_00047955,SubclassesOf), now going from MBON01 to MBON35.
 
 Note: All terms for these neuron types are available in the 
 [Drosophila Anatomy Ontology](http://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-anatomy-developmental-ontology), which can be browsed on [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/fbbt), which is also used by [FlyBase](http://flybase.org) and [FlyCellAtlas](https://flycellatlas.org/). Please consider using neuron type terms from this ontology to annotate your data.
