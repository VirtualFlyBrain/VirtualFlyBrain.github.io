title: Recent updates to the Drosophila Anatomy Ontology
---

The [Drosophila Anatomy Ontology](http://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-anatomy-developmental-ontology) is used by Virtual Fly Brain to annotate anatomical features, such as cell types, brain regions and tracts.

We have recently been expanding and updating our cell types based on recent results from adult brain electron microscopy studies.
 - This includes substantial improvements to our collection of [antennal lobe projection neurons](https://v2.virtualflybrain.org/org.geppetto.frontend/geppetto?q=FBbt_00067123,SubclassesOf) ([Bates et al., 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.042); [Marin et al., 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.028)).

 - We have also updated and added to our range of neurons associated with the adult mushroom body ([Li et al., 2020](http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62576)). We now have terms for the four unique [gamma-s Kenyon cells](https://v2.virtualflybrain.org/org.geppetto.frontend/geppetto?q=FBbt_00049830,SubclassesOf) (pictured below) as well as an increased range of [mushroom body output neurons (MBONS)](https://v2.virtualflybrain.org/org.geppetto.frontend/geppetto?q=FBbt_00047955,SubclassesOf), now going from MBON01 to MBON35.
