title: Recent updates to the Drosophila Anatomy Ontology
---

The [Drosophila Anatomy Ontology](http://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-anatomy-developmental-ontology) is used by Virtual Fly Brain to annotate anatomical features, such as cell types, brain regions and tracts.

We have recently been expanding and updating our cell types based on recent results from adult brain electron microscopy studies.
 - This includes substantial improvements to our collection of antennal lobe neurons ([Bates et al., 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.042); [Marin et al., 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.028)).

 - We have also expanded our range of mushroom body neurons ([Li et al., 2020](http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62576)).
