title: Recent updates to the Drosophila Anatomy Ontology
---

The [Drosophila Anantomy Ontology](http://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-anatomy-developmental-ontology) is used by Virtual Fly Brain to annotate anatomical features, such as cell types, brain regions and tracts.

We have recently updated our terms for components of the adult ventral nerve cord (VNC) based on the recent VNC nomenclature paper by [Court et al. (2020)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2020.08.005)

We have also been expanding and updating our cell types based on recent results from adult brain electron microscopy studies, including substantial improvements to our collection of antennal lobe neurons ([Bates et al., 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.042); [Marin et al., 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.028)) and mushroom body neurons ([Li et al., 2020](http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62576)).
